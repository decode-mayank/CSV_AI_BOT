1.  [How is your solution better than using the Bing Chat Plugin, which also uses GPT-4?](https://bitcot.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BitcotAI1/pages/202506241/1+How+is+your+solution+better+than+using+the+Bing+Chat+Plugin+which+also+uses+GPT-4) 
2. [Describe how you employ prompt engineering? Do you dynamically switch from Zero-shot to one-shot to multi-shot prompting for each question in the conversation?](https://bitcot.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BitcotAI1/pages/202178569/2+Describe+how+you+employ+prompt+engineering+Do+you+dynamically+switch+from+Zero-shot+to+one-shot+to+multi-shot+prompting+for+each+question+in+the+conversation) 
3. [How do you set parameters to the API like temperature (on what basis) to improve the quality of the response?](https://bitcot.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BitcotAI1/pages/202407940/3+How+do+you+set+parameters+to+the+API+like+temperature+on+what+basis+to+improve+the+quality+of+the+response) 
4. [Do you switch between multiple models (like ADA, Davinci etc) based on the complexity of the question - if the questions are easy, you can choose a simpler model to save costs? Do you have custom logic to determine how the model selection happens? Are you optimizing based on the number of tokens in the input and setting output limits as well?](https://bitcot.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BitcotAI1/pages/202211347/4+Do+you+switch+between+multiple+models+like+ADA+Davinci+etc+based+on+the+complexity+of+the+question+-+if+the+questions+are+easy+you+can+choose+a+simpler+model+to+save+costs+Do+you+have+custom+logic+to+determine+how+the+model+selection+happens) 
5. [How do you improve the quality of responses based on user feedback? What is the architecture for this?](https://bitcot.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BitcotAI1/pages/202211359/5+How+do+you+improve+the+quality+of+responses+based+on+user+feedback+What+is+the+architecture+for+this) 
6. [How are diagnostics stored in your system? How is it mined to progressively improve the quality of the model?](https://bitcot.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BitcotAI1/pages/202276888/6+How+are+diagnostics+stored+in+your+system+How+is+it+mined+to+progressively+improve+the+quality+of+the+model)
