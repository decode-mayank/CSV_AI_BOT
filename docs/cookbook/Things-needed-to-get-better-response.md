1.prompt 

## why prompt is important

--> prompt is one of the openai parameters. 

--> prompt is simply a piece of text that you provide to the model as a prompt or seed for generating additional text. 

--> The model then uses this text to predict what should come next, based on patterns and relationships it has learned from the vast amounts of data it has been trained on. 

--> when the prompt is instructed not to have outside query it will not answer to outside scope.

2.Choosing right model

The model that are being used is text-davinci-003 when compared to other model text davinci produces accurate answers

3.Choosing right parameter

Chossing right parameter is very important as it can reflect the response. More we choose right parameter will get better responses.
