Uh oh! Looks like there were some problems with last night’s sleep test. Not to worry, let’s walk through on how we can fix this. 
Insufficient data
It seems like we don’t have enough data to analyse your results. You need to sleep with the device for at least 4 hours in order for us to provide an analysis of your sleep. Try repeating the test again tonight, make sure you clock in those ZZZ’s!
Bluetooth instability
It seems like your smartphone cannot maintain a constant Bluetooth connection with the NightOwl sensor. This could be caused by the NightOwl sensor being out of range of the smartphone. We advise you keep your smartphone within a 2 metre radius of your bed.
If your NightOwl sensor was already within range, the issue could be with your smartphone. You can avoid this issue by using an alternative smartphone or tablet.

Poor signal quality
It appears that the sensor was incorrectly wrapped around your finger. Having the sensor on too tight or too loose can cause errors with the test. There is no need to strap the device tightly. If you experience any discomfort, readjust the adhesive wrap so the sensor gently attaches to your finger, without stretching the wrap. Similarly, the sensor should not be too loose. As long as the sensor maintains contact with your finger and stays in position during the night, we will be able to collect data for your sleep test.

Payment Methods,Are there any medical/ insurance rebates for therapy equipment?,"See here for local government rebate policies.
It all depends on where you live.
The NSW government provides a medical rebate of $0.16 per day or $0.32 per day if treatment is required for 24-hour usage. To apply for the rebate, customers should obtain the Application for the NSW Government Life Support Electricity Rebate form. This requires endorsement by your doctor.
The ACT government provides a Life Support rebate that includes therapy devices. The life support equipment must be prescribed by an ACT doctor for the treatment of a life–threatening condition.
The Victorian government provides a Life Support rebate and the Queensland government provides rebates via the Electricity Life Support Concession Scheme. However, in both of these states, therapy devices are not currently eligible. Western Australia and the Northern Territory do not have rebate schemes for therapy users.
The South Australian Energy Concession scheme is administered by the Department for Families and Communities.
In Tasmania an electricity supplier, Aurora Energy, provides a medical rebate of approx. $0.15 per day. To apply for the rebate, customers should obtain the application form for the Aurora Energy Life Support Electricity Rebate. This requires endorsement by your doctor.
These rebates can change without notice. We therefore recommend contacting your local govenment agency to confirm.",https://www.resmed.com.au/knowledge-hub/are-there-any-medical-rebates-for-therapy-equipment

Successful treatment is not just about ensuring that you have the ideal therapy device and mask. It’s also about receiving knowledgeable and reliable after-sales service that provides you with everything you need to get the best out of your treatment.
If you are thinking about purchasing ResMed products from outside Australia or New Zealand, either directly or via the internet, you should carefully consider the following facts.
ResMed authorised dealers are NOT AUTHORISED to sell to customers outside their own country, so you may not end up receiving a genuine ResMed product.
ResMed products are frequently customised to serve country-specific requirements.
The manufacturer's warranty and the servicing of products purchased overseas are not valid within Australia and New Zealand. If you purchase overseas and there is a problem, you must send your equipment back to the country of purchase for servicing and the shipping in of parts).
ResMed authorised dealers are not authorised to sell ResMed Products over the internet.
Local prices include a premium level of service, offered only by a ResMed accredited outlet.
For equipment purchased over the internet, no manufacturer's warranty, assistance with use, setting up of your device or any ongoing support is available in Australia and New Zealand. Any assistance or technical support you may require will incur fees.

Payment Methods,What happens if I buy a ResMed product overseas or over the internet and it is defective?,"You will have to deal directly with the seller themselves. Be aware of the following factors.
You have to deal directly with the seller. ResMed Service Centres are located in each region where accredited outlets sell and support ResMed products, and these Service Centres are certified to repair products sold only in those regions.
ResMed’s Global Warranty and Repairs Policy requires equipment to be returned to the region of purchase for a manufacturer's warranty claim. Therefore, any products purchased overseas or over the internet, require the customer to return the device to the country of the seller for repair.
Other factors you should be aware of include:
Some ResMed products feature regional customisations in their specifications to comply with local legislation or to conform to other local conditions.
Patients are encouraged to purchase from their own region with a guaranteed high level of service included, in order to prevent the sale of products without proper patient consultation or explanation prior to purchase.
Medical devices in Australia are regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and must be included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) before being made available for supply in Australia.
Devices purchased through a ResMed Accredited partner are listed in the ARTG and have evidence demonstrating that their record of safety, performance and quality is acceptable to the TGA.
Devices purchased overseas or via the internet for use in Australia may be in contravention of the Therapeutic Goods Act and Therapeutic Goods Regulations, and may also be subject to Australian Customs restrictions.",https://www.resmed.com.au/knowledge-hub/what-happens-if-i-buy-a-resmed-product-overseas-or-over-the-internet-and-it-is-defective
Payment Methods,Why is there a cost difference between similar products sold in Australia and the United States?,"The cost of ResMed products can vary across countries and regions of the world due to a number of factors.
The difference in healthcare systems in each country plays a major role in determining product prices within that country. The US government recognises the health consequence of untreated Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), and subsidises OSA therapy. Americans with health insurance may have their entire treatment costs covered. Accordingly, awareness of the condition is high, with product sales levels over 60 times higher than in Australia. As a result, prices in the US are lower because it is a high-volume, low-service environment.
In Australia, treatment for OSA is not fully reimbursed. You may only be entitled to claim part of the costs if your health insurance covers it. Fortunately, awareness of the severity of the condition is growing. ResMed regularly lobbies the government to subsidise OSA treatment, and if you’d like to help raise awareness you can also lobby your Local MP for OSA subsidies. Lower awareness means lower diagnosis rates and lower product sales within Australia, which impacts on cost. However, we are fortunate to have a higher level of service for Australian customers.
However, purchasing the ideal therapy device and mask is only part of what you need to successfully treat your OSA and enhance your health.
Having knowledgeable, trained experts on-hand together with receiving reliable after-sales service, ensures you get the support you need in adapting to treatment and achieving maximum results. Treatment for sleep apnea is not simple and requires ongoing consultation with your GP, specialist or clinically trained equipment provider. It is important that you receive ongoing advice and support to successfully adapt to treatment and start experiencing results.
ResMed’s Australian pricing generally offers you:
Reliable ‘before and after’ sales service (which covers education and awareness, support, mask selection, fittings and adjustments, setting up, and trialling new devices and masks for compatibility).
Additional follow-up consultations to monitor your treatment progress, after-sales service, warranties and repairs.
Access to the sleepvantage™ member support program, designed to support you on your sleep therapy journey.
So when you purchase a ResMed product within Australia, not only are you receiving equipment from a recognised world leading sleep specialist, you’re purchasing real peace of mind too.",https://www.resmed.com.au/knowledge-hub/why-is-there-a-cost-difference-between-similar-products-sold-in-australia-and-the-united-states
Payment Methods,"For Payment Plans, once the initial payment is made, when would the monthly instalments start?","In most cases it would start from the following month. 
If however you would like to nominate a start date within the first month, you can do so. So if you sign up on the 1st and wish to start debiting on your pay date which is the 15th, we can set it up that way, but it has to be within the first month.",https://www.resmed.com.au/knowledge-hub/for-payment-plans-once-the-initial-payment-is-made-when-would-the-monthly-instalments-start
Payment Methods,Why can ResMed’s products sometimes cost more than competitors’?,"ResMed products are designed to last, are user-friendly and engineered for ease-of-use.
Quality is embedded into the culture, systems and testing methods of ResMed, as is a commitment to listen and act on patient feedback to continually improve and enhance products.
We test in much tougher situations than would typically be experienced in a patient’s home. For example, we conduct extensive testing of therapy devices and components to ensure their reliability and endurance beyond a product’s anticipated life-cycle—so you can rest assured your therapy device will deliver quality treatment every night.
Customer evaluation of ResMed products during development is conducted regularly. Feedback from user evaluations, focus groups and market research ensures that ResMed hears the voice of the customer on satisfaction, comfort, mask fit and therapy deliverability. So if it is a ResMed product, you know it has been cleverly engineered, proven, and rigorously tested for durability, reliability, and performance.
ResMed is justifiably proud of the state-of-the-art facilities in Australia, where many of the products are manufactured.

Troubleshooting,"I'm getting red marks on my face from my mask, is there anything I can do?","There are a few tips to consider to help.
If you often wake up with redness or marks on your skin, you may need to adjust or replace your mask. Firstly, try adjusting your mask to a looser fitting so that you still achieve a good seal but with less pressure on your face. Try this for at least 2-3 nights. 
If that doesn't work, here are some tips you can try:
Consider the age of your cushion and headgear. A stretched headgear or a worn cushion may be contributing to the redness.
Make sure your mask is clean as a build-up may be causing irritation
Check you have the right mask size.
Some masks are available with soft wraps for the frame and act as an extra defense against facial marks.
Add a layer of padding between the cushion and your skin, with the

Gecko nasal pads
.
If you use both a nasal mask and a nasal pillows mask, alternate between wearing the nasal mask (which covers your nose) and the nasal pillows mask (which sits at the entrance of your nostrils). This can ease the pressure off different parts of your face
If you are using a full face mask, consider switching to the

Troubleshooting,How can I alleviate ear or sinus discomfort caused by therapy?,"There are a few suggestions to help with discomfort from mask fitting to mask type.
There are many causes of ear and sinus discomfort, and many ways to treat it. Here are some suggestions:
Make sure your mask is fitted correctly and is not leaking. The dry air caused by leak can create discomfort
If you are also waking with a dry mouth then consider switching to a full face mask to prevent air releasing from your mouth and drying out your throat
Increase your humidification level by small increments as this will add more moisture to the air you are breathing in

This message means that there is a significant amount of air leak coming from your equipment.
Most commonly, it is coming from the 
https://shop.resmed.com.au/sleep-apnea/cpap-masks/

, but leak can also be registered through holes in the tubing, or a faulty humidifier.
Begin by examining your tubing for any small holes, particularly near the ends. Check that there are no cracks in your humidifier chamber (usually found along the bottom) and that all equipment is fitting into the machine well. Remove the tub and take a look inside the machine. Check that the seals are not crushed or folded in.
Examine your mask for any obvious faults such as tears in the cushion or seals. If there are no obvious faults, consider the age and quality of your mask. Some signs that your mask may need to be replaced include stretched headgear, cushion discoloration and/or if your cushion has an oily appearance to it.
If everything appears fine, try completely re-fitting your mask. If you're unsure of how to do that we suggest making an appointment at your nearest

Troubleshooting,I'm getting irritating red marks on the top of my nose. How can I fix this?,"There are a few techniques you can try to fix this issue. Here is a list of things you can try.
If you are getting any irritation or redness on the top of your nose, then they are a few things you can do to try to fix the issue.
The first thing you should try doing is adjusting the straps of your mask so you are applying less pressure to the bridge of your nose. You will still want to make sure you are not experiencing any leak though, so try to find a happy medium between being not too tight and not causing any leakage.
If this doesn’t work, then there are a few other things you can try:
Make sure you are cleaning your cushion frequently as this can lead to red marks and irritation (we recommend once a day with our CPAP Soap and warm water in the morning).
Try adding a barrier between the skin of your face and the cushion with some 
https://shop.resmed.com.au/resmed-gecko-nasal-pad-10-pack/
Gecko Nasal Pads
 or 
https://shop.resmed.com.au/remzzz-full-face-padded-liners-for-resmed-and-philips-masks/
REMZzz Padded Liners
 (make sure you select the right size for the mask that you are currently using).
You may need to replace your cushion and/or headgear if they are starting to wear out or become worn.
Make sure you have the right sized cushion for your nose/face shape.
Consider swapping to a mask that doesn’t make contact with the top of your nose. There are a variety of options in both full face and non-full face designs that allow you to do this.
If you are using a 
https://shop.resmed.com.au/resmed-airfit-f20-full-face-mask/

 mask then you may want to consider trying out 
https://shop.resmed.com.au/resmed-airtouch-f20-cushion-3pk/

 instead as they incorporate a memory foam design that is much easier on the skin.

 is fully (and correctly) inserted into the device. When it is correctly inserted, the power button will light up.
Your power supply unit (PSU) may need replacing. Check to see if there is a bright green light on the top of your power supply (S9 and AirSense10 only). If not, the power supply unit will need replacing. If the light is on but the PSU is older than two years, consider replacing as it may be causing inconsistent powering.
If there's a message on the screen, follow the instructions to clear the message or contact your outlet
Ensure your

Check whether the filter is blocked. If so, you may need to 
https://shop.resmed.com.au/filters-for-resmed-s9-and-airsense-10-12-pack/
replace your filter
.
If you are experiencing a high amount of leak and the SmartStart™ setting is turned on, it's possible your machine is stopping due to this. Try turning off the SmartStart™ setting on your machine.
Check that the therapy machine's lid is properly closed (as well as the humidifier lid for applicable machines, such as the H5i™ humidifier in the S9™ device) or that the humidifier tub is fully inserted.
Check that the tubing is inserted correctly. If you are using a

, ensure that the heating element is inserted into the correct area.
Make sure you're not using the Start/Stop button to light the LCD during the night, as this will stop your therapy.
Ensure that no blankets or other objects are covering the power supply unit.
Try unplugging the machine, then plugging it back in again.

Troubleshooting,My tube is pulling while I'm sleeping which affects my mask seal. How can I fix this?,"'Tube drag' is when your tube pulls on your mask and affects the seal, causing leaks.
If you don't realise it's happening, you can find yourself tightening the mask for the wrong reasons and causing more leaks.
Many masks are designed to manage a certain level of tube drag. With the machine turned on, pull gently on the tube to find out what tube drag feels like. Roll around a bit in bed to see if your tube gives you enough room to move, and how much tubing you actually need. Most masks have longer tubing available if you need it.

Troubleshooting,Is your mask making funny noises?,"Funny noises may suggest you have an issue with your cushion seal and require re-fitting your mask.
If your 
https://shop.resmed.com.au/sleep-apnea/cpap-masks/
mask
 is making some burping or blurting sounds, it's likely that you have an issue with your cushion seal. This can usually be solved by re-fitting your mask.
More often than not the sound comes from the areas that touch your cheeks, so consider tightening the bottom straps of your mask. Keep in mind that even the best-fitting masks may still have some minor leaks, but there should generally be minimal leak from everywhere other than the vent.
Please note:
 Your mask should be fitted with any false teeth removed as this can also affect the seal of your mask.
If the noise does not subside, consider contacting us to arrange an appointment with one of our friendly sleep coaches on 1800 737 633 for a mask fitting.

Troubleshooting,Why is there a gurgling sound in the tube and condensation building up in the mask?,"A gurgling sound in the tube could be something known as CPAP Rainout - which you can prevent.
Are you currently experiencing a gurgling sound coming from your 
https://shop.resmed.com.au/sleep-apnea/cpap-machines/
CPAP machine
 and noticing water condensation in your 
https://shop.resmed.com.au/sleep-apnea/cpap-machines/accessories-parts/
tubing
 and 
https://shop.resmed.com.au/sleep-apnea/cpap-masks/
mask
?
If so it is likely due to something known as 
CPAP Rainout
.
CPAP Rainout occurs when the air travelling through the hose of your machine is warmer than the temperature of your room. This causes condensation to build up in both the tubing of your machine and your mask.
As a result, you may experience a gurgling noise (caused by air passing through the wet tubing of your machine) and notice moisture build-up in your mask. This can be quite uncomfortable and can lead to having a poorer night’s sleep.
Thankfully there are a few things you can do to prevent this:
Decrease the humidity level of your humidifier: 
By decreasing the humidity level, your humidifier will be producing less moisture. This will reduce the likelihood of condensation occurring in your mask or tubing.
Use a heated tube: 
Heated tubing can be helpful to keep the moist air coming from your humidifier at a consistent temperature as it travels through the tubing to your mask. If the temperature of the air remains constant during this time, then it is less likely to be converted into water droplets.
Insulate your tubing: 
Wrapping the tubing of your machine with something like a 
https://shop.resmed.com.au/resmed-slimline-tubing-wrap/
tubing wrap
 can be useful in preventing CPAP Rainout. Otherwise, you can try keeping the tubing of your machine underneath the covers of your bed while you sleep at night.
Increase the temperature of your room: 
By adjusting the ambient temperature of your room you may be able to prevent this issue from occurring. This can be as simple as turning the heater on to warm up the room a little before heading to bed.
As you may expect, CPAP rainout is more likely to occur during the colder months as the temperature begins to fall – so be wary about this happening during autumn and winter when things start to get cooler.
For further assistance please contact 1800 737 633.",https://www.resmed.com.au/knowledge-hub/why-is-there-a-gurgling-sound-in-the-tube-and-condensation-building-up-in-the-mask
Troubleshooting,My tube fills up with water at night. What can I do?,"Here's what you can do to reduce the build up of water in the tube.
You might have heard the term 'rainout' in reference to humidification. Basically rainout is condensation building up in the tube. If you have rainout, you might hear a gurgling sound in your tubing when you breathe on therapy.
Here's what you can do to reduce rainout:
Use 
https://shop.resmed.com.au/sleep-apnea/cpap-machines/humidifiers/
ResMed's Climate Control humidification
 solution, which is designed to provide enough humidification to help you breathe comfortably, while keeping rainout at a minimum. Make sure you're using a 
https://shop.resmed.com.au/sleep-apnea/cpap-accessories/tubing/
ClimateLine™ heated tube
.
If you're still experiencing rainout, try turning the humidity level down a little.
Rainout can happen if your bedroom gets too cold at night, so try to keep your room warmer overnight.

CPAP Product Tips,Any tips on managing mask leak with the AirFit F30 full face mask?,"Follow these steps to manage your mask leakage.
Leak often occurs when your mask's seal is compromised by movement, incorrect fitting or improper sizing.
To find the source of the leak, run your finger along the top and bottom edges of the ultra-compact cushion to feel if any air is escaping. There is an intentional vent on the front of the cushion where air will flow through. This is normal.
Adjust the mask cushion by gently pulling it away from your face and letting it reseal itself. 
Adjust the top, upper and/or lower headgear straps as needed to achieve a more secure seal.
Avoid overtightening the headgear straps - adjust them just enough to fix the mask leak.
Check to ensure the mask frame is secure and that the QuietAir elbow and air tubing are not pulling on your mask.
If the mask leak continues, contact your Sleep Coach.

CPAP Product Tips,My AirFit P10 (for AirMini) mask headgear seems too loose. Any tips?,"Watch this video on how to adjust your mask headgear.
Headgear Clip Tips
If the headgear seems too large, headgear clips are available to help you adjust the length of the split-strap for a better fit.
Attach the clips by threading either the lower or upper headgear strap through its opening.
Try the headgear on, and adjust the strap length with the clips until it is comfortable. For a tighter fit, shorten the straps. For a looser fit, lengthen the straps.
Note: Do not over tighten your headgear.
Headgear Tips
The headgear is designed to split open into a lower and an upper strap.
When the headgear is on, it should not be wrapped only behind your head. If it is, bring the top half up so that it sits on your crown.
When the headgear is on, it should not be resting only on your crown. If it is, pull the lower strap down to the back of your head.
Ensure that the headgear is not tangled or twisted.

 is a part of a 
https://shop.resmed.com.au/sleep-apnea/cpap-machines/

 that adds moisture to the air you breathe via a small heated tank of water. The humidified air helps to prevent a dry mouth during the night. Some CPAP machines may have humidifiers built-in, while others may use a separate part.
So... how does it work?
The bottom of your humidifier chamber has a metal plate that the machine heats up during the night. When the chamber is filled with water, the heat creates water vapor. The air that travels through the machine passes through the humidifier and collects the moisture and transports it up the tube.

Some of the main tubing options include:
Heated CPAP Tubes
: Heated tubes should only be attached if you’re planning on using a humidifier. When plugged into a machine, heated tubes help to vary warm air from the humidifier into your mask, and the warmth of the tube ensures that the heated air doesn’t cool off while it’s transported through the hose.
Standard CPAP Tubes
: Regular sized CPAP sleep tubes measure 22m in diameter and are suited to CPAP systems that do not contain humidifiers.
Slim CPAP Tubes
: Slimmer options such as 15mm tubes or ResMed SlimLine tubing. Many patients prefer a thinner tube because it is lighter and more responsive to movements throughout the night. A reduction in mask drag makes it easier for you to move naturally and comfortably in your sleep.

The answer to this question is that it depends on the model of machine you are using.
Thankfully, most modern CPAP machines are extremely quiet. This means you and your partner will be able to enjoy a quiet night’s sleep without the worry of a noisy machine.
The sound coming from a CPAP machine can be best described as ‘continuous and comfortable white noise.'
If you are hearing lots of noise from your CPAP machine, you may need to adjust your mask to minimise leak.",https://www.resmed.com.au/knowledge-hub/are-cpap-machines-loud
CPAP Product Tips,How do CPAP machines work?,"CPAP machines provide pressurised air in your throat via an air pump that is attached to a mask that covers your nose, nostrils or the mouth.
A sleep apnea machine provides pressurised air in your throat via an air pump that is attached to a mask that covers your nose or nostrils, or sometimes the mouth. The air pump and mask are linked by a tube that is attached to an airflow generating machine.
For someone diagnosed with sleep apnea, the machine acts as an air splint to keep the throat open, which is collapsing multiple times every hour during sleep causing them to choke or stop breathing.

CPAP Product Tips,Fitting your CPAP mask for the first time,"If it's the first time you’re fitting a CPAP mask, do so during the day.
You’ll need to re-adjust the straps of mask to make it fit properly. It's a good idea to wear the mask for an hour or two during the day so that you grow accustomed to it. 
Your mask should be fitted so that it is comfortable to wear in your usual sleeping position, with minimal air leakage. 
When fitting the mask initially:
Ensure that the straps are loose.
Hold the mask up to your nose and connect the headgear to the proper locations. It helps to do this in front of a mirror.
Make sure the mask is placed on your nose using any adjustment straps to adjust its location. 
Make sure the mask is snug but not overly tight. A common problem is over tightening so be sure the mask is just secure enough to sit on its own. The air from the CPAP will help to create a seal by inflating the mask cushion.
Last, turn on the CPAP machine to make sure there are no air leaks.

CPAP Product Tips,Why and how often should I get a new CPAP mask cushion?,"For optimal comfort replacing your mask regularly is important.
Like any piece of clothing or accessory, your mask cushion becomes worn out over time.

We highly recommend inspecting your mask according to the cleaning and maintenance routine outlined in your mask user guide. The user guide supplied with your mask contains guidelines to help you inspect, assess and replace your supplies.
Check for small tears or pinholes and anything else that might cause a leak. Household pets (and children) have been known to damage cushions by playing with them, so it's a good idea to keep your mask out of reach.

CPAP Therapy Tips,How to change the pressure on a ResMed CPAP machine?,"Here are some tips for getting the most out of your therapy.
You might get used to your therapy very easily - some people do. But don't worry if it takes you a little longer. That's normal.
Learning to use and live with your therapy equipment is about forming good habits, staying positive and practicing. It's also about getting comfortable. We'll show you a few techniques to help you make the most of your therapy.
At first, you might be very aware of the feeling of air in your throat. But this is something that you can get used to: try to relax your breathing and breathe like you do normally when you're awake.
Practice breathing with your sleep apnea machine in the daytime while you're relaxing or watching television, for instance. You don't need to worry about breathing out when you're sleeping; you will automatically breathe out against the flow of air.
If you continue to find it difficult, talk to your doctor or ResMed accredited outlet.
Here are some tips for getting the most out of your therapy: 
A ResMed device with the Ramp feature: this is where the machine pressure can be set to start at a lower pressure and 'ramp up' to your full therapy pressure over a maximum of 45 minutes, easing you into therapy.
A ResMed device with the SmartStart™ setting: this allows you to start therapy by breathing in, instead of pressing the 'Start' button. This lets you ease in to therapy so that you can get used to breathing with your mask on. 
A ResMed device with an EPR™ setting: this slightly lowers the pressure as you're breathing out, so breathing feels smoother and more natural.
A ResMed AutoSet™ device: this machine automatically adjusts the pressure delivered to you throughout the night, so pressure increases only as you need it.",https://www.resmed.com.au/knowledge-hub/how-to-change-the-pressure-on-a-resmed-cpap-machine

CPAP Therapy Tips,How can I tell if my CPAP mask needs replacing?,"It's important to inspect your mask regularly for signs of wear and tear.
Using a mask that is in good condition will help you achieve a good night's sleep. That's why it's important to inspect your mask regularly for signs of wear and tear. If you see any visible signs of cracking, discolouration or tears, then it's time to replace the part.
It's important to replace your mask regularly to ensure that you maintain comfortable, reliable therapy every night.
Some indications that it might be time to replace your mask (or parts of it) are if you:
often find yourself tightening and re-tightening the straps
notice the mask or cushion have lost their spring

CPAP Therapy Tips,What are the side effects of using my CPAP machine?,"You might experience some discomfort while adjusting to your CPAP therapy. 
The main adverse effects that people mention from CPAP therapy are skin irritation from the mask, as well as dry eyes, nasal congestion and airway dryness from the air. Most people will tell you that the most difficult part of CPAP therapy is getting used to using it initially. You’ll need time and patience to adapt to CPAP, but you should start to notice the benefits within 2 weeks of using it all night.1

Here are some tips:
Firstly make sure you place your sleep apnea machine on a flat, stable surface, where there's little chance it will get covered.
Place it close enough to you that you can reach the controls while you're in bed.
Leave plenty of room around the machine, and make sure it's not too close to a wall or heater.
Your doctor or ResMed authorised dealer should have shown you how to connect your sleep apnea machine and mask.

We recommended you speak with your doctor to check if you are eligible to have your CPAP machine covered by Medicare Australia. Please note that public funding of CPAP equipment differs between states, with each state also having different criteria for eligibility.
If you have extras cover, your private health insurance may pay a rebate towards the cost of your CPAP machine. The amount varies considerably between funds and also depends on your level of extras cover. Some funds will also cover part of the cost of the mask. Some funds require a letter of recommendation from your doctor. All require an eligible invoice.

Getting Started with CPAP,I'm finding it hard to fall asleep when using my sleep apnea therapy machine. Can you help?,"Some of your machine settings may have been determined by your doctor’s prescription. You can also consider the following solutions.
Try using the 
""Ramp"" option
 on your therapy machine. Designed to make therapy more comfortable, the Ramp feature helps you ease into therapy each night by setting your machine at a lower pressure than prescribed and slowly ramping up to your full therapy pressure over a maximum of 45 minutes. Using Ramp gives your device more time to gradually reach your prescribed therapy pressure - and gives you more time to comfortably fall asleep. Always talk to your doctor before making any changes to your therapy machine settings.

Practice breathing with your sleep apnea machine in the daytime while you're relaxing or watching television, for instance. You don't need to worry about breathing out when you're sleeping; you will automatically breathe out against the flow of air.

NightOwl App,NightOwl App - Error Code 10 (EC10),"Find out what this error means for your sleep test.
Uh oh! Looks like there were some problems with last night’s sleep test. Not to worry, let’s walk through on how we can fix this.
Bluetooth Instability
It seems like your smartphone cannot maintain a constant Bluetooth connection with the NightOwl sensor.
This could be caused by the NightOwl sensor being out of range of the smartphone. We advise you keep your smartphone within a 2 metre radius of your bed.
If your NightOwl sensor was already within range, the issue could be with your smartphone. You can avoid this issue by using an alternative smartphone or tablet. Open the instruction email we sent you on your new smart device. Follow the steps in the email to download and configure the app. You should be able to continue your home sleep test for the remaining nights.
Poor signal quality
It appears that the sensor was incorrectly wrapped around your finger. Having the sensor on too tight or too loose can cause errors with the test. There is no need to strap the device tightly. If you experience any discomfort, readjust the adhesive wrap so the sensor gently attaches to your finger, without stretching the wrap. Similarly, the sensor should not be too loose. As long as the sensor maintains contact with your finger and stays in position during the night, we will be able to collect data for your sleep test.

It appears that the sensor was incorrectly wrapped around your finger. Having the sensor on too tight or too loose can cause errors with the test.
There is no need to strap the device tightly. If you experience any discomfort, readjust the adhesive wrap so the sensor gently attaches to your finger, without stretching the wrap.
Similarly, the sensor should not be too loose. As long as the sensor maintains contact with your finger and stays in position during the night, we will be able to collect data for your sleep test.

Medicare rebated at home,What to do with your referral for a home sleep test with ResMed,"
Well done on getting your referral to get a home sleep test with ResMed! The next thing to do is to call our team for an appointment. We'll then schedule a time for you to pick up the home sleep test equipment. Our friendly staff will guide you through everything else you need to do, so there's no need to stress. Here's what you can expect.
If we haven't received your referral from your referring doctor when you call, we'll likely ask you to send it through. We'll then email you some forms to sign before your appointment. For your convenience, you can complete these on your phone or computer.
At the appointment, we'll provide you with all the sleep testing equipment and setup instructions. A ResMed sleep coach* will also be available to help you over the phone should you need support.
Here are some dos and don'ts to help you prepare for your home sleep test:
Familiarise yourself and set up your test equipment early
Shower at least an hour before your bedtime
Wear loose-fitting and comfortable clothes
Avoid applying moisturisers or creams to your face or upper body
Keep at least one finger free of nail polish (the one your test attaches to).
Once you're set up and in bed, try and sleep as you usually would. You need to keep the sleep testing equipment on all night, though, and only remove when you get up to start the day. It's okay to keep the equipment on if you get up during the night, but don't get it wet!
After you complete the test, you should pack all the equipment into the sleep testing bag and return it to a ResMed clinic the same morning. We need it to send your sleep data off to the reporting team promptly as well as to clean the equipment for the next user.
We'll send your sleep test results to your referring doctor once our reporting sleep physician has reported on it – usually within two weeks. And we'll keep a copy of your report on our secure patient management system, which you can review with a ResMed sleep coach*.
If you have any questions, please check out our FAQ's or contact our team on 1800 737 63 or at sleeptest@resmed.com.au.

There are certain things that are likely to increase your risk of experiencing a poor night's sleep.
- Increasing age increases your risk of insomnia1 and also reduces the hours of sleep you need each night.2
- Some medications and recreational substances, particularly when taken in the evening, can cause sleep difficulties.
- Being a woman makes it more likely you'll experience insomnia symptoms.3 Pregnancy, hormonal changes and menopause can all interfere with your sleep.
- Worry is a key driver of insomnia, particularly when it comes to short-term insomnia.
- Shift work can interfere with your sleep-wake cycle, making it difficult to sleep at the time when you need to.
- Jetlag is caused by travelling through several time zones in a west-east or east-west direction. Your body clock becomes confused about the right time to sleep and it can take several days to adjust to your new location.

Snoring,"My partner snores every night, does this mean he has sleep apnea?","Snoring may be a sign that your partner may have sleep apnea. Here are a list of possible symptoms.
If your partner snores, then it may be an indication that they have sleep apnea.
Snoring is caused by the partial obstruction of the upper airway. When this happens the tissues of our airway vibrate, causing the sound we known as snoring.
Other symptoms of sleep apnea include:
Waking up with a dry mouth/throat
Lack of concentration
Stopping breathing during the night
Waking up gasping for air
Daytime sleepiness
Waking up with a headache
Nocturia (needing to use the bathroom multiple times during the night)
Fatigue
Memory Loss
If your partner can relate to some of these symptoms, then it may be a good idea to have a sleep study done.
Your doctor may refer your partner to have a sleep test done, or you can

Snoring can be a sign that you’re not breathing properly when you sleep. As you fall asleep the muscles in your mouth, tongue and throat relax. Snoring occurs when these tissues relax too much and they partially block your airway and vibrate. Snoring is often associated with a sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea (or OSA). If your snoring is accompanied by excessive daytime sleepiness, morning headaches, gasping or choking or breathing pauses during your sleep it's time to see your doctor or take the home sleep test.

Sleep Apnea,Can you die from sleep apnea?,"Yes but not directly. Find out how sleep apnea affects you.
The answer is Yes - but not directly.1 When you have sleep apnea, your breathing stops while you sleep. This is called an ‘apnea’. Your brain senses a reduced oxygen level in your blood so it wakes you up so you start to breathe again. Every time you have an apnea, your blood pressure spikes and your heart rate increases until eventually you take a breath. This can happen many times a night without you even knowing. As you can imagine, this is not great for your health.2

Sleep Apnea,What are the different types of sleep apnea?,"Find out the three different types of sleep apnea here.
There are three types of sleep apnea.
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
Obstructive sleep apnea is by far the most common type of sleep apnea.5 It happens when your upper airways become blocked or partially blocked when you sleep. The blockage is usually in your nose or throat. Common obstructive sleep apnea causes are:
Being overweight (due to additional fat around your neck and airway)
Having inflamed tonsils or adenoids
Having a blocked nose due to an allergy or cold
The structure or shape of your nose, neck or jaw
Using sleeping tablets or sedatives
Being a smoker
Sleeping on your back
Loud snoring, gasping for breath and daytime tiredness are common warning signs of obstructive sleep apnea, although some people with obstructive sleep apnea don't snore much at all.  
2. Central sleep apnea
Central sleep apnea is more uncommon.1 It happens when your brain doesn’t tell your body to take a breath. Because central sleep apnea doesn’t cause much in the way of snoring, it often goes unnoticed.
3. Mixed sleep apnea
If you have a mixture of obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea, then you have mixed sleep apnea.

CPAP, or Continuous Positive Airway Pressure, treats breathing problems such as sleep apnea and chronic snoring, giving people healthier sleep and helping them enjoy better daytime alertness.1
CPAP applies mild air pressure to a person's upper airway to keep their airway open so that they can breathe normally while they sleep.

Sleep Apnea,What is sleep apnea?,"When you have sleep apnea, air stops flowing to your lungs for 10 seconds or longer – that is, you actually stop breathing.
Sensing you have stopped breathing, a control centre in your brain triggers you to wake up just enough to take a breath. Then you fall back to sleep and the cycle begins again. In some people this can happen over 30 times every hour even though you may not remember waking up.
As you can imagine, constantly being triggered back into breathing, hour after hour, night after night, can put a strain on your body. You may feel very tired day after day yet not realise that you’ve been waking up so many times at night as a result of having sleep apnea.

Sleep Apnea,Is sleep apnea hereditary?,"Research has shown that family history is a possible indicator of obstructive sleep apnea.
It's a very good question and the answer is a definite maybe.
To what extent do family members and their sleeping problems have a bearing on your own risk of developing sleep apnea?
In other words – in the same way that you may look like your relatives, there's a chance that you may also share similar facial structures which may make you more likely to have obstructive sleep apnea.
If you have a family member with obstructive sleep apnea, hopefully they’re actively seeking treatment through one of the many solutions available.
It's all backed up by research, which has found that family history is an indicator of the possibility of obstructive sleep apnea, with 25% to 40% of people who have it also having family members who have the condition.1
But if there's any possibility that you might have obstructive sleep apnea or have the potential to develop it, you'll definitely want to know – as obstructive sleep apnea can be dangerous to your health and well-being if left untreated.
As obstructive sleep apnea is caused by a blockage to the airways, physical traits that you may share with your family members such as your face and skull shape may also contribute to your risk of having it.
If you do have obstructive sleep apnea, effective treatment can make a big difference to the quality of your sleep and your waking life.

Whether it’s mild, moderate or severe, sleep apnea has disruptive effects on your body, disturbing your sleep-wake cycle as well as your blood and brain chemistry. Sleep apnea can affect your mood, lead to weight gain, daytime sleepiness, headaches, and memory problems.1
If left untreated, some effects also include:
Risk of accidents: Evidence suggests that people with untreated obstructive sleep apnea are nearly 2.5 times more likely to be the driver in a motor vehicle accident compared to other drivers.2 The study also found that by treating sleep apnea with CPAP therapy (for at least 4 hours per night) significantly reduced this risk.2
Mood: If you snore and experience mood problems and/or daytime sleepiness, these could be the effects of untreated sleep apnea. 21.5% of people with sleep apnea experience mood problems although women with sleep apnea are more likely to report mood disturbances than men.3
Daytime sleepiness: People with sleep apnea are often very sleepy during the daytime. This isn’t surprising when you consider how their sleep is being constantly interrupted. Daytime sleepiness puts you at risk of accidents. People with sleep apnea are 2.5 times more likely to be the driver in a car accident.2

Sleep Apnea,How does PAP or CPAP sleep apnea therapy work?,"A CPAP system is comprised of three basic components:
A 
machine
 that acts as an air pump;
A 
mask
 that covers the nostrils and sometimes the mouth; and
A 
tube
 that connects the machine to the mask and facilitates the transfer of pressurised air to the patient
The pump blows air pressure, which then travels through the tubing and mask and into the throat. CPAP helps treat sleep apnea by maintaining this flow of pressurised air. The pressure of the air keeps the throat open while you asleep, helping prevent or reduce apneas from occurring.
