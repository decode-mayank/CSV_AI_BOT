Can you die from sleep apnea?,"Yes but not directly. Find out how sleep apnea affects you.
The answer is Yes - but not directly.1 When you have sleep apnea, your breathing stops while you sleep. This is called an ‘apnea’. Your brain senses a reduced oxygen level in your blood so it wakes you up so you start to breathe again. Every time you have an apnea, your blood pressure spikes and your heart rate increases until eventually you take a breath. This can happen many times a night without you even knowing. As you can imagine, this is not great for your health.2

What is sleep apnea?,"When you have sleep apnea, air stops flowing to your lungs for 10 seconds or longer – that is, you actually stop breathing.
Sensing you have stopped breathing, a control centre in your brain triggers you to wake up just enough to take a breath. Then you fall back to sleep and the cycle begins again. In some people this can happen over 30 times every hour even though you may not remember waking up.
As you can imagine, constantly being triggered back into breathing, hour after hour, night after night, can put a strain on your body. You may feel very tired day after day yet not realise that you’ve been waking up so many times at night as a result of having sleep apnea.

Is sleep apnea hereditary?,"Research has shown that family history is a possible indicator of obstructive sleep apnea.
It's a very good question and the answer is a definite maybe.
To what extent do family members and their sleeping problems have a bearing on your own risk of developing sleep apnea?
In other words – in the same way that you may look like your relatives, there's a chance that you may also share similar facial structures which may make you more likely to have obstructive sleep apnea.
If you have a family member with obstructive sleep apnea, hopefully they’re actively seeking treatment through one of the many solutions available.
It's all backed up by research, which has found that family history is an indicator of the possibility of obstructive sleep apnea, with 25% to 40% of people who have it also having family members who have the condition.1
But if there's any possibility that you might have obstructive sleep apnea or have the potential to develop it, you'll definitely want to know – as obstructive sleep apnea can be dangerous to your health and well-being if left untreated.
As obstructive sleep apnea is caused by a blockage to the airways, physical traits that you may share with your family members such as your face and skull shape may also contribute to your risk of having it.
If you do have obstructive sleep apnea, effective treatment can make a big difference to the quality of your sleep and your waking life.

How to cure sleep apnea without CPAP therapy?,"There are a few methods you can try to help you manage your sleep apnea. Find out how.
Mild sleep apnea is when you’re having between 5 and 14 breathing pauses every hour.1 If you have mild sleep apnea, and you have no other medical conditions or risk factors, you can try using lifestyle changes and regular monitoring to manage your sleep apnea.2
In addition to achieving your ideal weight, quitting smoking and reducing alcohol, you can also try using a humidifier to decrease congestion in your airways and keep your nose unblocked. If you don’t mind the smell you can try using essential oils such as thyme, rose or eucalyptus. These are known for their anti-inflammatory effects.3

This message means that there is a significant amount of air leak coming from your equipment.
Most commonly, it is coming from the 
, but leak can also be registered through holes in the tubing, or a faulty humidifier.
Begin by examining your tubing for any small holes, particularly near the ends. Check that there are no cracks in your humidifier chamber (usually found along the bottom) and that all equipment is fitting into the machine well. Remove the tub and take a look inside the machine. Check that the seals are not crushed or folded in.
Examine your mask for any obvious faults such as tears in the cushion or seals. If there are no obvious faults, consider the age and quality of your mask. Some signs that your mask may need to be replaced include stretched headgear, cushion discoloration and/or if your cushion has an oily appearance to it.
If everything appears fine, try completely re-fitting your mask. If you're unsure of how to do that we suggest making an appointment at your nearest

",Troubleshooting
My tube is pulling while I'm sleeping which affects my mask seal. How can I fix this?,"'Tube drag' is when your tube pulls on your mask and affects the seal, causing leaks.
If you don't realise it's happening, you can find yourself tightening the mask for the wrong reasons and causing more leaks.
Many masks are designed to manage a certain level of tube drag. With the machine turned on, pull gently on the tube to find out what tube drag feels like. Roll around a bit in bed to see if your tube gives you enough room to move, and how much tubing you actually need. Most masks have longer tubing available if you need it.
Browse tubing options on our online store.

",Troubleshooting
Is your mask making funny noises?,"Funny noises may suggest you have an issue with your cushion seal and require re-fitting your mask.
If your 
 is making some burping or blurting sounds, it's likely that you have an issue with your cushion seal. This can usually be solved by re-fitting your mask.
More often than not the sound comes from the areas that touch your cheeks, so consider tightening the bottom straps of your mask. Keep in mind that even the best-fitting masks may still have some minor leaks, but there should generally be minimal leak from everywhere other than the vent.
 Your mask should be fitted with any false teeth removed as this can also affect the seal of your mask.
If the noise does not subside, consider contacting us to arrange an appointment with one of our friendly sleep coaches on 1800 737 633 for a mask fitting.

If so it is likely due to something known as 
.
CPAP Rainout occurs when the air travelling through the hose of your machine is warmer than the temperature of your room. This causes condensation to build up in both the tubing of your machine and your mask.
As a result, you may experience a gurgling noise (caused by air passing through the wet tubing of your machine) and notice moisture build-up in your mask. This can be quite uncomfortable and can lead to having a poorer night’s sleep.
Thankfully there are a few things you can do to prevent this:
As you may expect, CPAP rainout is more likely to occur during the colder months as the temperature begins to fall – so be wary about this happening during autumn and winter when things start to get cooler.

user guide

Leak often occurs when your mask's seal is compromised by movement, incorrect fitting or improper sizing. To find the source of the leak, run your finger along the top and bottom edges of the ultra-compact cushion to feel if any air is escaping. There is an intentional vent on the front of the cushion where air will flow through. This is normal. Adjust the mask cushion by gently pulling it away from your face and letting it reseal itself.  Adjust the top, upper and/or lower headgear straps as needed to achieve a more secure seal. Avoid overtightening the headgear straps - adjust them just enough to fix the mask leak. Check to ensure the mask frame is secure and that the QuietAir elbow and air tubing are not pulling on your mask. If the mask leak continues, contact your Sleep Coach. ",CPAP Product Tips

What is a CPAP humidifier?,"A part that adds moisture to the air you breathe.
A 
 is a part of a 
 that adds moisture to the air you breathe via a small heated tank of water. The humidified air helps to prevent a dry mouth during the night. Some CPAP machines may have humidifiers built-in, while others may use a separate part.
So... how does it work?
The bottom of your humidifier chamber has a metal plate that the machine heats up during the night. When the chamber is filled with water, the heat creates water vapor. The air that travels through the machine passes through the humidifier and collects the moisture and transports it up the tube.
Keep in mind that it is important to make sure that your humidifier and tube are cleaned regularly with warm, soapy water.

How can using a humidifier improve the comfort of therapy?,"A humidifier can make your therapy more comfortable and relieve a dry mouth and throat.
Many people with sleep apnea wake with a dry mouth and throat, which can be very uncomfortable.
A humidifier chamber, which is filled with water, will heat up during the night and allow water vapor to travel up the tube and relieve those symptoms of a dry mouth and throat. This will make your therapy more comfortable and allow you to sleep well and Awaken Your Best!

If the HumidX was not used every day during the 30-day period or used only for a week, it must still be replaced. It is a manufacturing recommendation that it must be replaced at 30 days of opening. When you breathe through it, be it once or 10 times, it is storing bacteria hence the manufacturer recommendation.

: Heated tubes should only be attached if you’re planning on using a humidifier. When plugged into a machine, heated tubes help to vary warm air from the humidifier into your mask, and the warmth of the tube ensures that the heated air doesn’t cool off while it’s transported through the hose. : Regular sized CPAP sleep tubes measure 22m in diameter and are suited to CPAP systems that do not contain humidifiers. : Slimmer options such as 15mm tubes or ResMed SlimLine tubing.

Check for small tears or pinholes and anything else that might cause a leak. Household pets (and children) have been known to damage cushions by playing with them, so it's a good idea to keep your mask out of reach.

Is snoring bad for you?,"Sometimes snoring can be an indicator that you aren't breathing properly when you sleep. Find out how this happens.
Snoring can be a sign that you’re not breathing properly when you sleep. As you fall asleep the muscles in your mouth, tongue and throat relax. Snoring occurs when these tissues relax too much and they partially block your airway and vibrate. Snoring is often associated with a sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea (or OSA). If your snoring is accompanied by excessive daytime sleepiness, morning headaches, gasping or choking or breathing pauses during your sleep it's time to see your doctor or take the home sleep test. Left untreated this can affect your health. You owe it to yourself to understand what causes snoring and learn how to stop snoring so everyone can breathe and sleep easier.
