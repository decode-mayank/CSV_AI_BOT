OptiPillows is an EPAP (Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure) nasal mask for the treatment of snoring but may also treat mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea.How it works:During inspiration the valve opens allowing you to breathe in easily. When you exhale, the valve closes and redirects the expired air through a narrow opening on the side of the valve. This creates Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure (EPAP) in the mouth which helps keep the upper airways open and prevents snoring and sleep apnea.
